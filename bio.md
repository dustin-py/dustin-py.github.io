subtitle: How'd I get here?
---
  It was July of 2017, I had just walked 27 miles down a seemingly abandoned highway, set up camp behind an abandond fire station, ready to give up on my adventure. I was tired, not a single soul was seen for miles, almost out of water and food. 
  I cried for an hour or so wondering what the hell I was doing with my life, 25 with nothing but; a guitar, a backpack, and 13 bucks to my name. Then everything changed, my entire perception of life, I was laughing uncontrolably yelling into the emptiness, "I'm free, I'm in control, I can do anything".
  
  From that moment I've traveled the country, got to be part of warped tour, worked in the movie buiseness, and now I'm here talking to you about my next great adventure into the world of Data Science.

- I have no desired path as of now, my general fields of interest are the entertainment industry, sports analysis, video game industy, but not limited to these things. 

- A particular business problem I would like to try and solve is creating a way for music labels/producers to find the next big music trend quickly without ever leaving their office/studio, once thats solved, create a social app to connect those musicians to these labels. I have a bad habit of dreaming big, just means I have to work a little harder.
