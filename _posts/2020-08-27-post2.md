  Most of us spend a majority of our lives in a 
vehicle going from 'a' to 'b'. 
  In light of that I decided to make predictive 
model that can tell you the injury severity of a possible collision.


### ***Figure1:***

- Above in ***figure 1*** you can see the inputs page of the model-app ( still in development ), I've entered some basic information for the model to use, such as age, driving experience, speed, etc.. With these inputs the predictive model will process them on the back end and return a page with a prediction of you the injury severity.

## Now let's see the results the model returns based on the inputs it was given.


## WE HAVE A PREDICTION!!

### ***Figure2:***

- This figure shows us the shaply plot, which explaines variables and how much each contributed to the outcome of the model. This isnt magic, thought it seems so. Shaply values are calculated using Game Theory.


### ***Figure3:***

- Here in figure3 is a plot showing speed in isolation. This plot is another way to show the impact a specific feature is having on the model and each of its predictable classes. In this plot I just used "speed" since it had the most impact out of all the other features.


### ***Figure4:***
#### Top: Random Forest Classifier Model
#### Bottom: Logistic Regression Model

  In this last plot are two confusion matricies, from these we can see the reason I chose to productionize the **Random Forest Classifier Model** is due to that fact that it  had a significantly better accuracy than the **Logistic Regression Model**.



## Notes about the process:
  For starters the data was loaded with data-leaks from information that can only be know after the accident had occured, such as; was it a frontal impact, aribag deployment, and a couple more. After that I used the few features left to engineer more features such as; speed, age_of_vehicle, and driver_experience.
  Once all of the data cleaning was done, then came time to build the model. I chose to use Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification. The Logistic model did not yeild the desired results, so I used Random Search Cross Validation to find which parameters would suit my model the best. Which led to the higher accuracy in the Random Forest Classifier.
  In conclusion, though I was able to get a higher accuray, this model would still not be very useful, It can be improved if more data was provided, such as; the accual model of the vehicle, the weight of the vehicle, the time of year, and the time of day. Those features would drive this models accuracy up.
