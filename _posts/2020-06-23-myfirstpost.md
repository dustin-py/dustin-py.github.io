>### Sorry to do this to you, but I'm gonna poke at the complexity of the brain again. So, our brains decided that nameing itself wasn't a great enough feat, therefore it continued to search the cosmos of curiosity and dive into why. Which led to examining the personalities of each brain. Now these test are used in schools to get a general idea of how to interact with that individuale student or in employment processes to see the strengths of a possible employee.

> ### What I've decided to do is figure out how these test questions make people feel when they read them to provoke the answer, do words with negative sentiment effect the decision?

###*Figure 1:*

### Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis

>Here in ***figure 1*** we can see the sentiment analysis of each question. The blue bars show the polarity on a scale from -1 to 1, where -1 shows negative emotion, 0 is neutral or no emotion, and  1 represents postive emotion. The green bars show the subjectivity on a scale 0 to 1, where 0 means that the sentiment is objective(fact) and 1 means that the sentiment is subjective(open to interpritation). 

> ### Another question I had is what are the general personalities of the test score population across multiple Countries?

##***Figure 2:***

>Above in ***figure 2*** is a heatmap displaying the average test scores per section from each of the top 20 countries with the most tests submitted.
