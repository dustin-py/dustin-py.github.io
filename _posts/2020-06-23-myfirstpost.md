## Question: 
Is there a large difference in base personality traits of individuals amongst a range of countries?

Personality, the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character. These characteristics or qualities are personality traits, which reflect people's characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Personality traits imply consistency and stability.


Here we will look at a specific test geared towards five base personality traits called, "The Big Five", also know as OCEAN.

Above in ***figure 1*** is a barchart displaying the average results of test scores in each trait by the top 20 countries that yeilded the most results. Also, to fine tune my observations this is only displaying test results from a single IP address. In other words, no test comes from the same network each is unique. The buttons on the right can be toggled to specify the trait that you would like to view.

## Here is a quick video that has a fun way of explaing traits a little further:

### ***Figure 2:***
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques.

Here in ***figure 2*** we can see the sentiment analysis of each question. The blue bars show the polarity on a scale from -1 to 1, where -1 shows negative emotion, 0 is neutral or no emotion, and  1 represents postive emotion. The green bars show the subjectivity on a scale 0 to 1, where 0 means that the sentiment is objective(fact) and 1 means that the sentiment is subjective(open to interpritation).
